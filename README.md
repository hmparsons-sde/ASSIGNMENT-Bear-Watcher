# BEAR TRACKER - PROJECT OBJECTIVES
To demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript modules, improve applied knowledge of Bootstrap and CSS styling, and advance use of DOM manipulation.

# USER STORIES
- 1. When the page loads, the user can use a Bootstrap form to create a new bear.
- 2. The form has two input fields: bear name and url for image of bear.
- 3. On submission, a new bear card will generate and print to the slider container. 
- 4. Each bear card has a translucent footer with the bear's name and two dynamic buttons that indicate that a bear has either attempted to catch or has succeeded 
     in catching a fish.
- 5. Upon adding a tracked event, the card's stats section will update with time stamped statuses.
- 6. Each bear's card will display a running tally of successful fish catches.
- 7. The bear with the highest count of fish catches will also appear in a separate "Awards" section with a gold award. 
     The second and third highest will display silver and bronze awards, respectively. Ties are allowed.
